# Restaurant of the Future(ROTF) 
## Our Submission for the Prototype Building Phase of [HackOn with Amazon 2021](https://hackon-with-amazon.hackerearth.com/).
### Software Stack: AI & Robotics
To assist the Hospitality & Service Sector in the COVID-19 Era, our team has proposed an Autonomous Bot that'll aid the restaurant personnel with their repetitive work. Our bot is equipped with LiDAR and Depth Cameras for navigation and obstacle-avoidance, powered by multiple micro-processors to drive the 3-wheeled Omni Drive around the restaurant. The bot is also capable of proper waste segregation and management using the latest AI tech. NLP based Chatbot acting as a User Interface backed with a scalable 3 Microservice Architecture at the backend and robust algorithms for navigation and task scheduling will provide the most comfortable and realistic experience for all the customers.

This repo contains the source code for the different functionalities of our bot. Each folder contains a README.md file describing the tech stack, along with a proper explanation of the file structure and execution steps wherever needed.

The Cost Structure along with a brief explanation of each functionality can be found in our [Idea Phase Submission](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P2Q0Wq7WKdGj4YcQsi9dySMYV8T4TuGq2-vklr7Ctko/edit#slide=id.gd60f7bbaa3_4_8). 

Similarly, the Mechanical models along with their working demo can be found [here](https://github.com/vanshgoyal/rotf-mechanical).
