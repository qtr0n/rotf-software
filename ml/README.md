# Garbage Segregation
Our bot can identify and segregate waste in 6 different categories namely cardboard, glass, paper, metal, plastic and trash. It uses transfer learning from a pre-trained Resnet- 50 model to generate a model which is capable of classifying images of individual waste objects into the mentioned categories.
Resnet- 50 model is pre-trained on ImageNet images with a size of 256 x 256 and classified into 1000 classes.
